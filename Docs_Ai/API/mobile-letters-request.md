# Letter request — mobile guide

`POST /letters/apply` with everything it needs, where each value comes from,
and the two things that make an otherwise correct request fail.

Every response below was captured from staging.

## The whole flow

```

One read, one write. Nothing else.

---

## Step 1 — load the lists

```http
GET /api/v1/letters/lov?enum=037400&lang=en
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "name": [
      { "code": "Service Certificate",      "meaning": "Service Certificate",      "used_value": "Service Certificate",      "description": "English" },
      { "code": "Basic Salary Certificate", "meaning": "Basic Salary Certificate", "used_value": "Basic Salary Certificate", "description": "Arabic" }
    ],
    "mobileNo":    [ { "used_value": "55112233" } ],
    "deliveryLoc": [ { "used_value": "Al Khor Hospital" }, { "used_value": "Al Wakra Hospital" }, { "used_value": "Main Office - Doha" } ],
    "exitCopies":  [ { "used_value": "1" }, { "used_value": "2" }, { "used_value": "3" }, { "used_value": "4" }, { "used_value": "5" } ],
    "defaultCopy": [ { "used_value": "1" } ],
    "language":    [ { "used_value": "Arabic" }, { "used_value": "English" } ],
    "country":     [ { "used_value": "Bahrain" }, { "used_value": "Egypt" }, { "used_value": "Jordan" } ]
  },
  "opstatus": 0,
  "status": "success",
  "httpStatusCode": 200
}
```

Counts on staging today: **22** letters, **9** delivery locations, **5** copy
options, **11** countries.

Always send `used_value` back, never `meaning`. On `lang=ar` the `meaning`
becomes the Arabic label for display, while `used_value` stays the value the
server expects.

---

## Step 2 — the language is not a choice

**This is the one rule that breaks most first attempts.**

Every letter exists in exactly ONE language, and the server looks it up by name
**and** language together:

```sql
flex_value_meaning = p_letter_name AND UPPER(description) = UPPER(p_letter_language)
```

Get the pair wrong and there is no such row, so the request is rejected.

Take both from the **same row**:

```dart
final letter = lovs.name[selectedIndex];

body['p_letter_name']     = letter.usedValue;    // "Service Certificate"
body['p_letter_language'] = letter.description;  // "English"
```

### Do not use `language[]` for this

`language[]` contains exactly two entries — `Arabic` and `English`. It is the
list of languages that exist in the system, **not** a choice for the current
letter. Pairing a name from `name[]` with a language from `language[]` is what
produces a valid-looking request that the server refuses.

### What the screen should look like

Do **not** show a language dropdown. Show the language as read-only text beside
the letter:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Letter    [ Service Certificate         ▾ ] │
│ Language    English            (read-only)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Choosing "Basic Salary Certificate" changes that text to `Arabic` on its own.
Any letter marked Arabic is **issued in Arabic** — the user cannot request an
English copy of it, because none exists.

`?lang=` on the URL is unrelated: it controls the language of *labels and error
messages*, not the language the letter is printed in.

---

## Step 3 — the remaining fields

```dart
body['p_mobile_number']       = lovs.mobileNo[0].usedValue;
body['p_letter_delivery_loc'] = lovs.deliveryLoc[i].usedValue;
body['p_no_of_copies']        = lovs.exitCopies[i].usedValue;
body['p_purpose_comments']    = commentsController.text;
```

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `p_mobile_number` | Must be a number already on the employee's HR record — take it from `mobileNo[]`. A typed number is rejected, and so is one carrying a country code (`+974…`). |
| `p_letter_delivery_loc` | From `deliveryLoc[]`. Nine values today, e.g. `Al Wakra Hospital`, `Main Office - Doha`. |
| `p_no_of_copies` | From `exitCopies[]` — `"1"` to `"5"`. `"0"` is rejected. `defaultCopy[]` gives the value to preselect. |
| `p_purpose_comments` | Free text from the user. **Required** — an empty string fails validation. |
| `p_country` | **Omit it.** See below. |

### `p_country` — omit it

The country lookup inside the procedure is guarded by

```sql
AND 'Passage to Saudi Arabia' = <letter>
```

so for any other letter it can never match, and sending one guarantees a
rejection. Show the country field **only** when the selected letter is the
Saudi passage one; otherwise leave the key out of the body entirely.

---

## Step 4 — submit

```http
POST /api/v1/letters/apply?lang=en
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "p_letter_name": "Bank letter with details with effective date",
  "p_letter_language": "English",
  "p_no_of_copies": "1",
  "p_mobile_number": "55112233",
  "p_letter_delivery_loc": "Al Wakra Hospital",
  "p_purpose_comments": "test comments"
}
```

```json
{
  "result": { "successflag": "S", "message": "Success" },
  "opstatus": 0,
  "status": "success",
  "httpStatusCode": 200
}
```

**Always branch on `successflag`, not on the HTTP status** — this endpoint
returns 200 for a business rejection too.

| `successflag` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `S` | Submitted for approval |
| `N` | Rejected — show `message`, which is already localized |

---

## Field reference

| Body field | Source | Required |
|---|---|---|
| `p_letter_name` | `name[i].used_value` | yes |
| `p_letter_language` | `name[i].description` — **same row** | yes |
| `p_no_of_copies` | `exitCopies[i].used_value` | yes |
| `p_mobile_number` | `mobileNo[i].used_value` | yes |
| `p_letter_delivery_loc` | `deliveryLoc[i].used_value` | yes |
| `p_purpose_comments` | user input | yes |
| `p_country` | `country[i].used_value` | only for the Saudi passage letter |

---

## The 22 letters and their languages

Read this from `name[].description` at runtime — it is data and can change.
The current state, for reference:

| Letter | Issued in |
|---|---|
| Bank letter with details with effective date | English |
| Bank letter with details without effective date | English |
| Bank letter with housing allowance details | English |
| Basic Salary Certificate | **Arabic** |
| Completion of Probation Period Certificate | **Arabic** |
| Completion of Probation Period without salary | **Arabic** |
| Hajj to Saudi Arabia Letter | **Arabic** |
| No Objection of Marriage Certificate (non Qatari) | English |
| Passing through Saudi Arabia | **Arabic** |
| Salary Certificate with salary details | English |
| Salary Certificate with salary details (Arabic) | **Arabic** |
| Service Certificate | English |
| Service Certificate with basic salary only | English |
| Service Certificate with official language of HMC | English |
| Service Certificate with school assistance | English |
| Service Certificate with total salary | English |
| Service Certificate with total salary with accommodation and tickets | English |
| Service Certificate: employee has no loans | English |
| Service certificate without salary (Arabic) | **Arabic** |
| Services/Salary Certificate including deductions | English |
| Total Salary Certificate | **Arabic** |
| Umrah to Saudi Arabia Letter | **Arabic** |

Note the pairs that look alike: *Salary Certificate with salary details* is
English, and *Salary Certificate with salary details (Arabic)* is a separate,
Arabic letter. The user picks the language by picking the letter.

## Errors, and what each one means

### 422 — a value was not recognised

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "One of the values sent was not recognised. Please re-check the values chosen from the lookup lists.",
  "status": "error",
  "httpStatusCode": 422
}
```

Almost always one of:

1. the name/language pair does not exist together;
2. a mobile number that is not on the employee's record;
3. a delivery location that is not in the list;
4. `p_country` sent with a letter other than the Saudi passage one.

This used to be a **404**, which read like a broken endpoint. It is not — it is
a rejected value.

### 400 — a field is missing or malformed

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Validation failed.",
  "status": "error",
  "httpStatusCode": 400,
  "errors": { "details": ["p_purpose_comments should not be empty"] }
}
```

`errors.details` names the field. Please surface it during development rather
than a generic message — it identifies the problem immediately.

### An HTML page instead of JSON

```html
<html><head><title>Request Rejected</title></head>
<body>The requested URL was rejected. Please consult with your administrator.
<br><br>Your support ID is: 15468526370066589295</body></html>
```

**This is the WAF in front of the API, not the API.** The request never
arrived.

The usual cause is content in the body that looks like markup or an injection
attempt. A confirmed example: leaving a placeholder such as

```json
"p_mobile_number": "<selected LOV used_value>"
```

in the request. The angle brackets trip the filter. Replacing it with a real
value from `mobileNo[]` makes the same request succeed.

Detect it by checking whether the response body starts with `<html` — no valid
API response ever does — and treat it as "request blocked", not as a server
error. Rapid repeated POSTs can also trigger it briefly; retrying after a few
seconds succeeds.
